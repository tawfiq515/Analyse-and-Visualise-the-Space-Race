# Space Race Analysis  

Python data analysis of space mission statistics with visualizations of launch trends, costs, and success rates.  

## Features  
- Mission launch frequency by organization and year  
- Cost analysis of space missions over time  
- Monthly launch patterns and success rate trends  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.8+  
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Usage  
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`  
2. Run the Jupyter notebook  
3. Update data path if needed  

## Install dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter

## Usage
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
Open Analyse_and_Visualise_the_Space_Race.ipynb

## Update the data path if needed:
csv_file_path = "your/path/to/mission_launches.csv"
Run all cells to generate visualizations

## Key Visualizations
Missions by Year - Line plot showing launch frequency by organization

Cost Trends - Scatter plot of mission costs over time

Monthly Patterns - Bar chart of launches by month

Success Rates - Line chart showing mission success percentage over time

## Data Requirements
Dataset should contain these columns at minimum:

Date: Mission launch date

Organisation: Launching organization

Price: Mission cost (numeric)

Mission_Status: Success/Failure status

## Dependencies
Python 3.8+

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

jupyter (for notebook interface)
